# Four things to do with Quarto

I've been thinking of learning Quarto, the open-source scientific and technical publishing system 
for awhile now so I thought I would just jump in and create a first post detailing what I actually want to use 
Quarto for. 
I'm a bioinformatican by trade and a few of my projects have ended in web apps like RShiny, which 
are great for allowing the biologist to access, visualize and query the 
analysis and data. Recently though I've been thinking that instead of 
making web-apps and dealing with things like hosting and security it might be
easier for everyone involved if I just create reports instead.
Interactive reports that can be placed on a shared 
directory or standalone HTML that can be sent via e-mail automatically when 
the analysis is done. There is lots of things to use Quarto for like
creating this blog but for conceptual symmetry here are four:

1. Discuss figures alongside generated text
2. Embed widgets like plotly plots
3. Create smart tables 
4. Allow for downloads 


If your intreasted in the actual markdown code that was used to produce
this webpage then you can find here on my github.


## Discuss figures alongside generated text

I'm going to break my four things about quarto rule straight out the gate
as this is really two things. A bioinformatic reports are usually going to 
numerous figures and will have to be shown next to text in relatively neat
way. Automatically generated reports also is going to contain some automatically 
generated text, loaded into the report from a nearby config file. 

The figure was produced from 
automated snakmake pipeline which pseduoaligned maize RNA-Seq reads to 
the maize transcriptome. The reason is pseduoalined is that instead of 
aligning reads to transcriptome like a aligner, kallisto just sort of 
matches the reads to a part of the transcriptome with a few additional steps.
I'll go into that in more detail when I do my blog post on the snakemake 
kallisto pipeline.


![Maize Pseudoalignment Summary](figures/maize_pseudoalignment_summary.svg){fig-align="left" fig-alt="Just a nice figure." width=70%}


So the figure looks fine. Most biologists have seen these figures many times
before and would in a moment tell that the proportion of reads pseduoaligned 
across all samples is above 80% so no problems here. Say I need to show
multiple figures for multiple runs, giving each figure a empty chunk of 
web page to hang out in would get ugly fast so I can use quarto markdown to
get the figures shown side by side. 


```

```

Looks good but if I had more runs to show, and more figures to describe
each run it could get confusing fast. It would be beneficial to only show 
one runs figure at a time and get the user to click which figure they want 
to see. This can be done using a panel tab, shown below along with the markdown
code to produce it.

Below is rules diagram from my snakemake pipeline and it looks okay but 
its large with a lot of things going on. The figures is made automatically 
from the snakemake automation pipeline and the fact it looks like it makes 
sense means the I set up the snakemake correctly.

![](figures/testA_rulegraph.svg)

The figure is very very large and longer then wide so it would be good to 
see if the figure could be smaller aligned to the left with some sort of 
descriptive text to the right of the figure.

## Better DAG 

Heres the figure smaller and aligned to the left but cant figure out how to 
get the figure in one col and the text in another. I see some folk tackle 
this with some latex css stuff but id really rather not. Will check to see 
if I can do something with captions.

Below is a panel tabset which are really good for getting multiple figures onto 
a page without stretching it out to much.

What would be really cool is a dataset within a dataset. Which I will try to do 
down below with some more figures I got from the kallisto snakemake running the

## Create a list

These are the movies I saw in 2022 that I can remember on the 7th of January 2023. There must be more then this. None of these are even proper comedies...

1.  Emma

2.  NOPE

3.  Everything, Everywhere, All the Time

4.  The Batman

5.  Glass Onion

6.  Pinocchio

7.  Ponyo

8.  Wendell and Wild

## Embed a widget

I made some html widgets during my work on a snakemake NGS project so I'm going to try to embed them here.
Depending on how it looks, I might change the snakemake to save plotly plots as Rdata



## Add a wee table 


Here is the pseudoalignment summary tables.


## Add a smart table 

Here is some random metadata table you can see I've added tooltips 

## Download a file 

If you like that pseudoalignment summary table then you can download it
