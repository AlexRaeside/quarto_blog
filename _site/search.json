    "text": "Welcome to my Blog. I’m NGS bioinformatician by trade and have been interested in doing something with quarto reports in my projects for a while. I’ve made some Rshiny apps before but I’m starting to think that a lot of the bioinformatics problems that get solved with apps maybe should be getting solved with interactive reports. I’m still learning quarto and getting my thoughts together but it would be so much easier to give the biologists your working with a standalone HTML with some interactive tables, figures and text instead of deploying a full web-app and having to deal with VPNs and servers. So I decided to start this quarto blog to learn more about quarto. I have also always wanted a blog and to write about movies and video-games.\nSo the blog will primarily hype up any bioinformatics projects I do in my spare time, talk video games, and movies and act as a dev log for when I finally get around to starting a Godot project. Godot is an open-source, very lightweight game engine with its beginner-friendly language GDScript (I know no C#). I’ve been messing around a little with Godot for about a year now and would love to finish something to say I have. GDscript has a python-like syntax, but Godot can integrate python within projects, so it would be great to have a Godot project doing something interesting with python.\nSee ya,\nAlexander Raeside"

    "text": "I’ve been thinking of learning Quarto, the open-source scientific and technical publishing system for awhile now so I thought I would just jump in and create a first post detailing what I actually want to use Quarto for. I’m a bioinformatican by trade and a few of my projects have ended in web apps like RShiny, which are great for allowing the biologist to access, visualize and query the analysis and data. Recently though I’ve been thinking that instead of making web-apps and dealing with things like hosting and security it might be easier for everyone involved if I just create reports instead. Interactive reports that can be placed on a shared directory or standalone HTML that can be sent via e-mail automatically when the analysis is done. There is lots of things to use Quarto for like creating this blog but for conceptual symmetry here are four:\n\nDiscuss figures alongside generated text\nEmbed widgets like plotly plots\nCreate smart tables\nAllow for downloads\n\nIf your intreasted in the actual markdown code that was used to produce this webpage then you can find here on my github.\n\n\nI’m going to break my four things about quarto rule straight out the gate as this is really two things. A bioinformatic reports are usually going to numerous figures and will have to be shown next to text in relatively neat way. Automatically generated reports also is going to contain some automatically generated text, loaded into the report from a nearby config file.\nThe figure was produced from automated snakmake pipeline which pseduoaligned maize RNA-Seq reads to the maize transcriptome. The reason is pseduoalined is that instead of aligning reads to transcriptome like a aligner, kallisto just sort of matches the reads to a part of the transcriptome with a few additional steps. I’ll go into that in more detail when I do my blog post on the snakemake kallisto pipeline.\n\n\n\nMaize Pseudoalignment Summary\n\n\nSo the figure looks fine. Most biologists have seen these figures many times before and would in a moment tell that the proportion of reads pseduoaligned across all samples is above 80% so no problems here. Say I need to show multiple figures for multiple runs, giving each figure a empty chunk of web page to hang out in would get ugly fast so I can use quarto markdown to get the figures shown side by side.\n\nLooks good but if I had more runs to show, and more figures to describe each run it could get confusing fast. It would be beneficial to only show one runs figure at a time and get the user to click which figure they want to see. This can be done using a panel tab, shown below along with the markdown code to produce it.\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n## Dataset A\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n## Pseudoalignment summary \n![](figures/maize_pseudoalignment_summary.svg)\n\n## PCA\n![](figures/maize_pca_vst_counts_filtered_medi200.svg)\n\n:::\n\n## Dataset B\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n## Pseudoalignment summary \n![](figures/rat_pseudoalignment_summary.svg)\n\n## PCA\n![](figures/rat_pca_vst_counts_filtered_medi200.svg)\n:::\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\nThe panel tab\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow is rules diagram from my snakemake pipeline and it looks okay but its large with a lot of things going on. The figures is made automatically from the snakemake automation pipeline and the fact it looks like it makes sense means the I set up the snakemake correctly.\n\nThe figure is very very large and longer then wide so it would be good to see if the figure could be smaller aligned to the left with some sort of descriptive text to the right of the figure.\n\n\n\nHeres the figure smaller and aligned to the left but cant figure out how to get the figure in one col and the text in another. I see some folk tackle this with some latex css stuff but id really rather not. Will check to see if I can do something with captions.\n\nBelow is a panel tabset which are really good for getting multiple figures onto a page without stretching it out to much.\n\nDataset ADataset B\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat would be really cool is a dataset within a dataset. Which I will try to do down below with some more figures I got from the kallisto snakemake running the\n\nDataset ADataset B\n\n\n\nPseudoalignment summaryPCA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPseudoalignment summaryPCA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n:::\n\n\n\nThese are the movies I saw in 2022 that I can remember on the 7th of January 2023. There must be more then this. None of these are even proper comedies…\n\nEmma\nNOPE\nEverything, Everywhere, All the Time\nThe Batman\nGlass Onion\nPinocchio\nPonyo\nWendell and Wild\n\n\n\n\nI made some html widgets during my work on a snakemake NGS project so I’m going to try to embed them here.
